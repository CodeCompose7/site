## Course Overview

This course is designed for those who want to reliably deploy and operate machine learning models in production environments.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand MLOps concepts and the full ML lifecycle
- Design data and training pipelines
- Introduce model registries and versioning
- Plan model deployment and monitoring strategies

### Course Structure

**Part 1: MLOps and Pipeline Fundamentals**
- Background and motivation for MLOps
- Data pipelines vs training pipelines
- Concepts of Continuous Training (CT)

**Part 2: Tools and Platforms**
- Experiment tracking with MLflow or Weights & Biases
- Model registry and version management
- Overview of workflow orchestration with Kubeflow / Airflow

**Part 3: Deployment and Monitoring**
- REST API-based model serving (e.g., FastAPI + Docker)
- Monitoring model performance and data drift
- Rollback strategies and A/B testing concepts

### Teaching Method

- **Online/Offline**: Zoom or in-person sessions
- **Hands-on focused**: Building pipelines with example datasets and models
- **1:1 Feedback**: Reviews of students' MLOps project architectures

### Target Audience

- Those who have built ML models and want to put them into production
- Data scientists, ML engineers, and backend developers

### Prerequisites

- Python and basic machine learning knowledge
- Familiarity with Git and basic DevOps concepts (recommended)
