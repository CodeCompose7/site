We deliver custom, on-demand lectures for companies, schools, and study groups.

We also organize the materials, insights, and experiments produced in those lectures  
into articles and practical examples.

For more details,  
visit the [Courses]({{< relref "courses/_index.en.md" >}}) section for curricula and hands-on exercises,  
and the [Tech blog]({{< relref "blog/_index.en.md" >}}) section for paper reviews and technical insights.
