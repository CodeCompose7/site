We organize the materials, insights, and experiment logs from our courses  
into articles and practical examples.

We also deliver custom lectures for companies, schools, and study groups,  
and publish parts of that content as public resources.

For more details,  
visit the [Tech blog]({{< relref "blog/_index.en.md" >}}) section for paper reviews and technical insights,  
and the [Courses]({{< relref "courses/_index.en.md" >}}) section for curricula and hands-on exercises.
